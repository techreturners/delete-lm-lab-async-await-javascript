# Exercise 2

## Task 1 - Convert fetchData into async/await

In `exercise002.js` you will find a function called `fetchData()` that takes an API endpoint and returns some data converted into JSON.

Your task is to convert this function so that instead of using `.then()` and `.catch()` it uses the more modern `async`/`await` keywords and `try{} catch{}` syntax.

Have a go, if you get stuck reach out to one of the coaches for guidance. ðŸ’œ

Finished? Great! Time for some bubble tea, mmm! ðŸ§‹
